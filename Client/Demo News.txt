Dengue has intensified its grip on the city ,  as the mosquitoes transmitting the disease are now thriving not only in the most densely populated areas ,  but also in the outskirts and posh areas of the city. Sanganer ,  Sodala and the old city reported the highest number of dengue cases this year so far. The three areas account for 35% of the total dengue cases reported in the city. Health department has appealed to the residents to change water in containers etc every week to prevent breeding of mosquitoes. Five deaths have been reported in the city in past one month. Two of these persons belonged to the Walled City ,  while one each belonged to Durgapura ,  Mansarovar and Jamwaramgarh. The deaths could have been prevented ,  if the residents destroyed the larvae-breeding sites in houses on time. Health department has appealed to the residents to change water in containers etc every week to prevent breeding of mosquitoes According to the health experts ,  dengue can be prevented easily by not allowing water to stagnate for more than a week. If the water which is collected in flower vases ,  earthen pots for offering water to birds ,  tyres and other such trash items thrown at rooftops of houses ,  water tanks etc ,  is changed every week ,  mosquito breeding can be prevented ,  said an expert. The old city ,  which is known as Pink City ,  is not in the pink of health. The Walled City reported 202 dengue cases till November 17. Besides ,  the situation is even worse in Sanganer ,  which has reported 337 dengue cases this year. Also ,  in Tonk Road/Sodala ,  239 persons have tested positive for the disease. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are responsible for transmission of diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. Teams of health department along with Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) teams are frequently visiting the areas and issuing warning to the residents not to allow mosquito breeding in their houses. So far ,  202 persons have tested positive for dengue in the Walled City area. For keeping the disease under control ,  we are continuously visiting the area and inspecting houses. Those house where larvae are found ,  we immediately issue them notices to change the water ,  said Dr Narrottam Sharma ,  chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). In the past one month ,  two persons have died in the old city area due to dengue ,  which has evoked concern from the health authorities. However ,  the JMC officials are also alert on dengue. We receive reports from the health department daily on the new cases of dengue. We prepare a daily plan of fogging activities on the basis of the area-wise report we receive from health department of dengue cases. We serve notices to the residents first if we found larvae in the houses. If we find larvae in our second inspection ,  we impose a fine of Rs200 ,  said Dr Sonia Agarwal ,  senior medical officer ,  JMC. So far ,  the JMC has issued challans to 155 houses in the city.

Six more people were confirmed positive for Zika virus in Rajasthan on Thursday ,  taking the total number of people infected to 106 in the state ,  a Union Health Ministry official said. The current total number of affected people with the virus is said to be the largest Zika outbreak in the country. According to official report ,  the six new Zika cases confirmed were from Jaipur and two neighbouring districts and of the total affected people ,  25 are pregnant women. More than 1 lakh households have been surveyed in the densely populated Shastri Nagar and neighbouring areas and 324 teams have been engaged to destroy mosquito larvae found during the survey ,  state health department official said. According to reports ,  the Zika virus is most prevalent in the Shastri Nagar area ,  where authorities have carried out fogging and other anti-larvae activities ,  while the pathogen has already been found in some mosquitoes taken as samples from Sindhi Camp area in Jaipur. Meanwhile ,  in view of the rising case ,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) team on Wednesday rushed to the state to accelerate measures to stop its spread. A team of experts from ICMR has reached Jaipur to change the insecticides which are being used in the city and neighbouring districts to kill mosquitoes that spread Zika ,  dengue ,  and chikungunya viruses as a part of the integrated mosquito management programme ,  the official said. The Union Health Ministry on October 16 directed all the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to monitor the situation on daily basis and urged people not to panic. Sources at the state health department said almost all Zika virus infected patients are healthy after receiving treatment ,  while three-fourth patients do not have symptoms of disease and have recovered. The state health department has also issued an advisory for pregnant women not to visit the affected areas as expecting mothers are more susceptible to this mosquito-borne virus. It was on September 22 ,  the first case had surfaced when an 85-year-old woman with no travel history tested positive for the disease in the state. The virus is transmitted through the aedes aegypti mosquito. It causes fever ,  skin rashes ,  conjunctivitis ,  muscle and joint pain. It is harmful to pregnant women ,  as it can lead to microcephaly ,  a condition in which a baby"s head is significantly smaller than expected ,  in newborn children. In India ,  the first outbreak was reported in Ahmedabad in January 2017 and the second in Tamil Nadu"s Krishnagiri district in July that year. Both these outbreaks were successfully contained through intensive surveillance and vector management ,  the ministry had said earlier.The disease continues to be under surveillance of the Union Health Ministry although it is no longer a Public Health Emergency of International Concern under WHO notification since November 18 ,  2016.

When the Swachhta Survekshan 2020 was going on till January 30 and all over the city sanitation situation in the entire city was up to the mark. Almost all the municipal employees were involved in it. Sanitation inspectors and in-charge were appointed in all the wards to closely monitor the situation. Every day ,  officials used to conduct morning inspection of the city. The situation improved in the city and garbage was picked up on time from the garbage depots. This all has changed as the Swachhta Survekshan ended. A JMC official on condition of anonymity said that slowly officials have returned to their routine work.

Two days after the murder of a mother-son duo in Jaipurs Pratap Nagar area  ,  the police are yet to arrest or even detain any suspect. The murdered womans husband remains on the polices radar ,  but it appears that the cops have found no solid evidence against him. Two persons were rounded up from Vaishali Nagar area and are being interrogated. However ,  the officials did not divulge anything. Sources told TOI ,  the husband ,  who is also the complainant in this case ,  is not cooperating much in the investigation. After the womans body was found in a bloodied state in her flat on Tuesday ,  police found her sons body in a deserted area close to the residential complex where the family lived. While the husband Rohit Tiwari has neither been officially detained nor arrested ,  the cops are keeping him under watch at the local police station. The brutal murders of his wife Shweta Tiwari and son Shreyam had sent shock waves across the city. Rahul Jain ,  DCP East ,  Jaipur said ,  We are talking to Rohit though obviously he is saying that he has no reason to kill his child. Through CCTV footage ,  we confirmed that he was at work at the time of the killings. We are looking at all possible leads to solve the case at the earliest. Tiwaris family also reached Jaipur on Thursday while the cremation of the murder victims was done in Kanpur by Shwetas family. Sources told TOI that Rohit was playing it smart and not cooperating in the investigation and an official on condition of anonymity said ,  There are many things which he is not revealing and not cooperating as well. There are many suspicious aspects about his involvement in the murders. Since he is the complainant as well in the case ,  so we have to be very careful with the investigation. Rohit ,  a native of Delhi and an Indian Oil Corporation employee ,  had moved to the city two years ago with Shweta ,  a native of Kanpur. He was at work when their maid found her body in the living room on Tuesday and informed neighbours ,  who alerted cops. Shreyam had been missing since then. On Wednesday afternoon ,  a police search party ultimately found the childs body in the forest area just over the boundary wall of the residential complex where the family lived. Sources said the body was dumped there on Tuesday itself.
